You are a very good guy! I personally don’t know u much still when last time u were leaving this colony I literally thought u won’t come back but when uncle rejoined everyone was happy! Pulling vaidehis leg together is really fun!! Also congratulations for your placements. Wishing you a great year n life ahead! N expecting few IT hacks in future. Happy birthday once again! 🥂
