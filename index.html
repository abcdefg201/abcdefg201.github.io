							<p>Hey Devesh! 
								Happy birthday to you! 🎂
								I know you since I was 3-4 yrs n I literally discovered it when I saw our picture at Amrut hotels garden when I was 12 It was so shocking to me that I asked mum n Aunty n everyone abt it! You are a very good guy! I personally don’t know u much still when last time u were leaving this colony I literally thought u won’t come back but when uncle rejoined everyone was happy! Pulling vaidehis leg together is really fun!! Also congratulations for your placements. Wishing you a great year n life ahead! N expecting few IT hacks in future. Happy birthday once again! 🥂

							<p>"Your 'first cry' ,21 years ago, has become the reason for the happiness of so many and, I'm very sure you cannot deny this fact as you see IT on their faces today. I consider myself to be one of those most fortunate people who has had the prerogative of scribing some of the happiest moments in this book of life with you in them. And, I look forward to add more such "instances of overweening joy" ,only to be more grateful for life, as we meet today."</p>
